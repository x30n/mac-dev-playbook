# Mac Development Ansible Playbook

This playbook installs and configures most of the software I use on my Mac for web and software development.

This playbook will be updated throughout my life with various features, functions and roles - but they will always convey the same purpose.

## Installation

  Run the following from the command line, and enter your administrative password when requested.
  
  Note that initially you'll need to install xcode command line tools before you can proceed.
  
### App store Authentication
  
  Note that MACSTOREUSER and MACSTOREPASS will need to be replaced with your details, and MAS must be a part of homebrew's package list.
  
  1. `xcode-select --install`
  2. `curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fubarhouse/mac-dev-playbook/master/install.sh | bash -s -- MACSTOREUSER MACSTOREPASS`

### Non-authenticated method.
  
  If your user account is definitely logged into the Apple store, authentication isn't essential so you can use the following instead of the above commands.
  
  1. `xcode-select --install`
  2. `curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fubarhouse/mac-dev-playbook/master/install.sh | bash`
